#Inspiration
In a lot of cases crowd funding platforms do not provide enough evidence to. End users are not provided with the funding required or there is a lot of financial discrepancies between the money promised and money received, which leads to various legal complexities. In order to prevent this, we are developing the first decentralized platform Transparent Charity, to make the process better.

#What it does
We built a web application that is a crowdfunding platform, which will support a cause by providing money through Solana pay on the Solana blockchain. For everyone who want to support a specific cause, they will redirected to a QR code which will allow them to transfer solana token from one address on the blockchain to another without any middlemen, with every transaction monitored on the ledger, contributing towards supporting the cause.

#How we built it
We utilized html, css, javascript and python for the front-end part of the website. We utilized the next.js, typescript. python, and the solana-pay product for connecting the back-end part of it.

#Challenges we ran into
It took time to integrate the front end of the application for each respective transaction happening on the backend.

#Accomplishments & What we learnt
We never implemented payments in blockchain earlier. So we had to learn how to incorporate the payment gateways securely into our application, without any vulnerable endpoints.
We had a great opportunity to learn more about Solana and how to implement it.

#What's next for TransparentCharity
We are going to develop the product into a cross-platform application and customize it to varying needs.
